        <h2 id="quote">“The best programs are written so that computing machines can perform them quickly and so that human beings can understand
            them clearly. A programmer is ideally an essayist who works with traditional aesthetic and literary forms as
            well as mathematical concepts, to communicate the way that an algorithm works and to convince a reader that the
            results will be correct.”
